Link for the Colab file: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-3p2iPeusNVEr1q8LhEHGTllkf8db1Ov#scrollTo=_JYyBsbaIXV4

In the Colab, I have discussed:
- How to create the ONNX file
- How to quantize it for smoother operation
- Getting the metrics after restricting the max RAM and CPU threads

Close all the Blocks and then have a glance through each of them as per your neeeds and requirements.

All other files are given in this directory itself.
